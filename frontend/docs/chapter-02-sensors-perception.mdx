# Chapter 2: Sensors and Perception

## Introduction

Perception is the foundation of physical AI. Without the ability to sense the environment, robots cannot act intelligently in the world. This chapter explores the sensor modalities that enable robots to perceive, the algorithms that process raw sensor data into meaningful information, and the challenges inherent in robotic perception.

## Vision Systems

### Cameras and Image Sensors

Cameras are the most information-rich sensors available to robots, providing millions of pixels of data at high frame rates.

**Camera Types**:
- **Monocular**: Single camera, loses depth information
- **Stereo**: Two cameras enable depth perception through triangulation
- **RGB-D**: Combined color and depth cameras (e.g., Microsoft Kinect)
- **Event cameras**: Asynchronous pixels that respond to brightness changes

**Key Parameters**:
- **Resolution**: Number of pixels (e.g., 1920×1080)
- **Frame rate**: Images per second (typically 30-60 fps)
- **Field of view**: Angular coverage (wide-angle vs. telephoto)
- **Dynamic range**: Ability to handle bright and dark regions simultaneously

### Computer Vision Algorithms

Raw images must be processed to extract useful information:

**Feature Detection**: Identifying distinctive points in images (SIFT, SURF, ORB) for tracking and matching.

**Object Detection**: Locating and classifying objects in scenes using deep neural networks (YOLO, Faster R-CNN, SegFormer).

**Semantic Segmentation**: Labeling every pixel with its object class for dense scene understanding.

**Depth Estimation**: Computing distance to surfaces from images, either through stereo matching or monocular depth networks.

**Optical Flow**: Tracking pixel motion between frames to estimate camera or object movement.

## Range Sensors

### Lidar (Light Detection and Ranging)

Lidar uses laser pulses to measure distances with centimeter-level accuracy.

**Operating Principle**: Measure time-of-flight for laser pulses to reflect back from surfaces:

$$
d = \frac{c \cdot t}{2}
$$

where $d$ is distance, $c$ is the speed of light, and $t$ is round-trip time.

**Lidar Types**:
- **Scanning Lidar**: Rotating mirror creates 360° scan
- **Solid-state Lidar**: No moving parts, more reliable
- **Flash Lidar**: Illuminates entire scene simultaneously

**Applications**:
- Simultaneous Localization and Mapping (SLAM)
- Obstacle detection for autonomous vehicles
- 3D reconstruction of environments

### Ultrasonic Sensors

Ultrasonic sensors use sound waves beyond human hearing range (>20 kHz) to measure distance.

**Advantages**:
- Inexpensive and robust
- Work in dust, fog, and darkness
- Detect transparent objects (unlike vision)

**Limitations**:
- Lower accuracy than lidar (~1 cm)
- Narrow beam can miss small obstacles
- Slow update rates

### Radar

Radio Detection and Ranging uses electromagnetic waves for sensing.

**Advantages**:
- Long range (100+ meters)
- Works in all weather conditions
- Measures velocity directly via Doppler shift

**Applications**:
- Automotive collision avoidance
- Industrial safety zones
- Aerial obstacle detection

## Tactile and Force Sensing

### Touch Sensors

Tactile sensors detect physical contact and measure applied forces.

**Types**:
- **Binary contact sensors**: Simple on/off switches
- **Force-sensitive resistors**: Resistance changes with applied force
- **Capacitive sensors**: Detect proximity and touch
- **Optical tactile sensors**: Use cameras to observe surface deformation

### Force/Torque Sensors

Six-axis force/torque sensors measure forces ($F_x, F_y, F_z$) and torques ($\tau_x, \tau_y, \tau_z$) at robot joints or end-effectors.

**Applications**:
- Compliant manipulation (adjusting grip force)
- Assembly tasks (detecting part mating)
- Human-robot interaction (safe collaboration)
- Surgical robotics (delicate tissue manipulation)

## Proprioceptive Sensors

Proprioception is the sense of self—knowing the configuration and state of the robot's own body.

### Encoders

Encoders measure joint angles with high precision.

**Types**:
- **Incremental encoders**: Count pulses from a reference position
- **Absolute encoders**: Provide unique position codes
- **Magnetic encoders**: Use magnetic fields, robust to dust

**Resolution**: Measured in pulses per revolution (PPR), typically 1000-10,000 PPR.

### Inertial Measurement Units (IMUs)

IMUs combine accelerometers and gyroscopes to measure motion.

**Accelerometers**: Measure linear acceleration in 3 axes:

$$
\vec{a} = [a_x, a_y, a_z]^T
$$

**Gyroscopes**: Measure angular velocity:

$$
\vec{\omega} = [\omega_x, \omega_y, \omega_z]^T
$$

**Applications**:
- Estimating robot orientation (roll, pitch, yaw)
- Detecting falls or collisions
- Stabilizing flying robots (drones, quadcopters)

### Current Sensors

Measuring motor current provides information about torque and load:

$$
\tau = K_t \cdot I
$$

where $\tau$ is torque, $K_t$ is the motor torque constant, and $I$ is current.

This enables torque control without dedicated force sensors.

## Sensor Fusion

Real-world robotic systems combine multiple sensor types to overcome individual limitations.

### Kalman Filtering

The Kalman filter optimally combines predictions from a motion model with noisy sensor measurements.

**Prediction Step**: Estimate state based on previous state and control input.

**Update Step**: Correct estimate using new sensor measurement.

The Extended Kalman Filter (EKF) handles nonlinear systems, commonly used for robot localization.

### Complementary Filtering

Combines high-frequency data from gyroscopes with low-frequency data from accelerometers to estimate orientation without drift.

### Particle Filters

Represent beliefs about state as a set of weighted samples (particles), effective for non-Gaussian distributions and multi-modal hypotheses.

## Perception Challenges

### Sensor Noise and Uncertainty

All sensors have noise characteristics:
- **Random noise**: Zero-mean fluctuations (white noise)
- **Systematic bias**: Consistent offset from true value
- **Drift**: Slow change in calibration over time

Robust perception algorithms must account for uncertainty.

### Environmental Variability

Perception systems must handle:
- **Lighting changes**: Shadows, glare, day/night cycles
- **Weather**: Rain, fog, snow affecting visibility
- **Dynamic objects**: Moving people, vehicles, animals
- **Occlusions**: Objects blocking view of targets

### Computational Constraints

Vision processing can consume significant computational resources:
- Deep neural networks require GPUs for real-time inference
- Lidar point clouds contain millions of points
- Sensor fusion algorithms run at high frequencies (100+ Hz)

Edge computing and specialized hardware (TPUs, FPGAs) help meet real-time constraints.

### Sim-to-Real Gap

Perception models trained in simulation often fail on real sensor data due to:
- Different noise characteristics
- Rendering artifacts
- Domain shift in object appearance

Domain randomization and real-world data collection address this challenge.

## Modern Perception Architectures

### Deep Learning Pipelines

Modern robotic perception heavily relies on neural networks:

**Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs)**: Extract spatial features from images through learned filters.

**Transformers**: Attention mechanisms capture long-range dependencies, enabling powerful vision models (ViT, DINO).

**3D Networks**: Process point clouds directly (PointNet, PointNet++) or voxelized representations.

### Multi-Modal Fusion

Combining camera and lidar data leverages strengths of both:
- Cameras provide texture and semantic information
- Lidar provides accurate geometry
- Fusion networks learn to combine complementary information

### Self-Supervised Learning

Large-scale robot perception benefits from self-supervision:
- Temporal consistency: Adjacent frames should have coherent predictions
- Geometric constraints: Stereo pairs or lidar provides supervision for depth
- Contrastive learning: Similar views should have similar representations

## Conclusion

Sensors are the interface between physical AI systems and the world. From cameras and lidar to force sensors and IMUs, each modality provides unique information about the environment. Effective perception combines multiple sensors through fusion algorithms, processes data with modern deep learning techniques, and handles uncertainty inherent in real-world sensing.

The next chapter explores how robots move through space using the principles of kinematics and dynamics.
